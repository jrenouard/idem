var smalltext = "When Hannah initially appears, she seems like a regular woman that wants to forget her dark past. She also seems to show signs of seduction when Dexter is swabbing her cheek for DNA. In the next episode, Run, Hannah reveals that she and Wayne were dreamers, wanting to settle down on a farm in Argentina. She also seems touched that Wayne's last words were about her. Later on, Hannah quietly toys with one of her \"trophies\", right in front of Dexter. This implies that she misses the joy of the kill, and it causes Dexter to investigate her further. In her next appearance, she seems scared of the old memories as she shows Miami Metro where the bodies are. But when Dexter discovers that she had to be one of the assailants in this case, he later confronts her about a scar on her palm. Hannah tells Dexter that it was a scar she got from talking back to Wayne, but Dexter immediately calls her out on her lies. She tells him \"That's my story, and I'm sticking to it,\" implying that her past may be more sinister than she has let on. When questioned by Dexter if she enjoys killing, Hannah is quick to say \"no\", but that, to her, killing is just nature's way of addition and subtraction. She claims that sometimes a life is needed to be taken - a sort of survival of the fittest. She affirms that she is the \"fittest\" so far. However, though she is a killer, it appears that out of spite of her sociopathic nature, she only kills those that have wronged her or out of self-defense, as most the people who she killed have caused her trouble or pain (her counselor sexually abused her, her husband demanded an abortion or he'd leave her, Sal tried to ruin her and Dexter's lives and Jurg tried to kill her and she killed him out of self-defense). However, there are some she has in fact killed that were innocent. She has also shown great defense skills, such as pulling a knife on Dexter after they had sex due to him almost killing her and questioning why he does what he does and later outsmarting Jurg with spicy foods and a lamp over his head. It is unclear if Hannah has kept her humanity and can feel real emotions over certain things or if she is just very capable of concealing her dark side. In the process of telling Dexter about her time with Wayne, she opens up about wanting to live the \"dream life\" and not caring what it took to get there. She also has an emotional break down during an interview with Sal Price over her first kill at age 15. In the same episode, she reveals genuine distraught over mentions of her miscarriage, in which Dexter narrates, \"she's not acting\". Another sign of her genuine emotions was when she was interviewed by Sal and she revealed immense distraught over killing that innocent woman during her time with Wayne and again when her father yelled at her for being a killer and \"a mistake\", causing Hannah to cry uncontrollably both times.";
